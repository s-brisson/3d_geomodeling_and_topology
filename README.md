### 3d_geomodeling_and_topology

In this repository you can find the code that I used for creating a stochastic, 3D, implicit model ensemble of the Eastern Alps triangle zone. You can also find the code for inversion using topological information, a methodology applied to a simple synthetic model case and later to the more complex Eastern Alps model.
